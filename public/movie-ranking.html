<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Greatest trilogy ever made. I could go on but won't. Content speaks for itself.</p>

<h3>What Dreams May Come</h3>
<p>Just a beautiful story starring Robin Williams about love, loss and grief. The cinematography is beautiful too. Quite unique.</p>

<h3>Fist of Fury</h3>
<p>First movie I recall seeing in my youth at the Drive-In. Was hooked on Bruce Lee and martial arts ever since.</p>
